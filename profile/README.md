> **Oxyde** is a modern desktop environment written in **Rust**, designed with a **Frutiger-Aero** and **Aqua-era** aesthetic — smooth glass, soft blur, and the nostalgia of early-2000s UI design, reborn for modern Linux.

---

## 🌐 Overview

**Oxyde** aims to capture the *soul* of classic GUIs while leveraging the performance and safety of modern Rust.  
It’s inspired by Windows XP’s Luna, Apple’s Aqua, and the sleek minimalism of early GNOME — all wrapped into a clean, modular system that runs fast and stays light.  

Our goal is simple:
> 🧊 *Bring back personality and polish — without the bloat.*

## ⚙️ Core Goals

- 🦀 **Rust-Powered Compositor** – Built for stability, safety, and speed  
- 🪟 **Frutiger-Aero UI** – Soft lighting, transparency, reflection, and motion  
- 💨 **Under 1 GB RAM Usage** – Efficient by design  
- 🧰 **Modular System** – Replace or extend components easily  
- 🎨 **Retro Feel, Modern Core** – Aqua meets Aero meets Linux

## 💾 Design Philosophy

> “Every pixel should feel alive.”

Oxyde revives the visual richness of early GUIs with subtle blur, refraction, and glassy depth — but built for *modern GPUs* and *efficient compositing pipelines*.  
The system is modular, transparent, and unapologetically nostalgic.

- 🧬 *Retro UX, modern underpinnings*  
- 🪩 *Hand-crafted icons and windows inspired by Aqua & Aero*  
- 🧠 *Optimized for Wayland from the ground up*

## Current Development Goals

The project’s active goals focus on refining both the technical foundation and user experience:

- **Desktop Environment** — Develop a fully functional environment using a custom-modified Wayland compositor.  
- **User Interface** — Implement cohesive Aqua-style theming through C, inspired by early-2000s design.  
- **Core Components** — Build a responsive taskbar, “Start” menu, file manager, and power/reboot interface using Rust and C integration.  
- **Kernel Optimization** — Continue tuning the [Lynx Kernel](https://github.com/0xy1de/Oxyde-Lynx-Kernel) to prioritize user input, reduce latency, and remove unnecessary modules for maximum efficiency.  
- **System Aesthetics** — Design and implement consistent icon sets and system artwork that reinforce the retro aesthetic.  
- **Compatibility** — Deeply integrate Wine for improved legacy and Windows software support.  
- **Future Development** — Add a custom login and session management system as part of the long-term roadmap.
